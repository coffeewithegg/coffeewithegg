# `Adam`

Adam is the entrypoint backends for Coffeewithegg. It is responsible for managing other projects to deploy, run, and monitor them. It can scale down to zero when there is no project running, and scale up when there is a new project to run. The main purpose of Adam is to managing cost and resources for my projects.
